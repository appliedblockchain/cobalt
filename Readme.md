## Summary

Fast, lightweight ethereum dapp prototyping.

### What is it? What's the difference compared to truffle?

Truffle team did a great job, if truffle framework works for you - you should stay with it.

Cobalt is an alternative take on ethereum dapp development. It's lightweight, no magic (globals etc.), instant compilation (for ultra-short modify-compile-test cycle) same web3@1.x api in tests and production code, straight forward deployment without migrations (we think dapps have more complex deployment story than patterns based on traditional database migrations), small codebase.

Cobalt gives you decorated web3 with:
* `web3.require('Foo.sol')` - which compiles solidity files and makes them available for deployment, and
* `const foo = async web3.deploy('Foo', [], { from, gas, links?: { ... }, ... })` - to deploy a contract.

That's all - the rest are helpers to simplify common tasks during dapp development.

## Prerequisites

`cobalt` uses the `solc` command-line compiler, make sure you've got it:

    brew update
    brew upgrade
    brew tap ethereum/ethereum
    brew install solidity
    brew linkapps solidity

Confirm it's installed:

    solc --version

If you want to setup Circle CI or similar CI, you can fetch `solc` compiler with:

    wget https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.4.23/solc-static-linux && chmod +x solc-static-linux && sudo mv solc-static-linux /usr/bin/solc

## Installation

    npm i -D @appliedblockchain/cobalt

## Usage

See [examples](./examples) directory.

## Deploy

To deploy a contract from your terminal you can use something like:

    cobalt-deploy -g 5000000 -f 0xfa9c654833f3e977b0f7c07c60bb69b656a47af7 -s HelloWorld.sol

### Example jest test

`./contracts/Foo.sol`
```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.5.9;

  contract Foo {
    string myVariable;

    function sendFoo(string data) public {
      myVariable = data;
    }

    function getFoo() constant public returns (string) {
      return myVariable;
    }
  }
```
`./test/foo.test.js`
  ```javascript
  const { join } = require('path')
  const { map, first } = require('lodash')
  const { web3, accounts } = require('@appliedblockchain/cobalt/web3')({
    root: join(__dirname, '..', 'contracts'), // Contracts directory: if removed, defaults to `./contracts`.
    accounts: 10,
    logger: console
  })

  const addresses = map(accounts, 'address')
  const from = first(addresses)
  const gas = 50000000

  // Compile one or more .sol files.
  web3.require('Foo.sol')

  afterAll(async () => {
    web3.close()
  })

  describe('Foo', () => {
    let Foo

    test('deploys', async () => {
      const contractConstructorArgs = []
      Foo = await web3.deploy(
        'Foo',
        contractConstructorArgs,
        { from, gas }
      )

      expect(typeof Foo.options.address).toBe('string')
      expect(Foo.options.address.length > 1).toBe(true)
    })

    test('sets and gets data', async () => {
      const data = 'someData'
      await Foo.methods.sendFoo(data).send({ from, gas })

      const result = await Foo.methods.getFoo().call()

      expect(result).toEqual(data)
    })
  })
```
